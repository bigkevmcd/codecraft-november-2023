# Python examples

To run the tests run `python3 -m unittest` in the relevant directory.

You will need to make the tests pass.

## Using Visual Studio Code?

You will need the Python extension installed.

You will also need to configure the Python tests via the "Python: Configure Tests" command.

The tests use `unittest` with filenames beginning `test_*.py`.
